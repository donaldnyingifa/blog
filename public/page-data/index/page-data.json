The fall is set, and spring is upon us. Verdant green, red bloom and yellow sun rays were the characteristics of the day. The sun is bold, much bolder than back home at this time of the day. It was around 9.45am. I found myself heading for the University hall. This has been my weekly routine every Tuesday for the past two months. Our English lecturer, Professor Sturgis had earlier informed us that we will be going to the red dot and the students’ union building. We left the class around 10.15am for the site seeing.</p>\n<p>The Red Dot is located few meters away from the University hall. It is a painting on the ground. It is circular in shape and red in color. The Red Dot is actually used to indicate the middle of the school. Chairs for relaxation are around the Red Dot. It is also > surrounded by blooming red trees and green grasses. When I sat down to observe the surrounding, I felt the free flow of wind. I was surprised to see donuts, and bottled water for us. Professor Sturgis must be a very nice man for getting us donuts and water. I could not wait to start eating it. Watching my fellow students was fun for me.</p>\n<p>I could hear Nigerian chants so even if I was American, I would know these are foreigners because their accent is conspicuous.  Wanaemi, the pseudo model, was being her usual self taking pictures. Nadine was sitting close to her love interest. Some other students paired in groups of twos and threes to make small talk. I did not really pay much attention to other students.</p>\n<p>The Red Dot is very close to Wright hall. The trees close to the surrounding are aligned in perfect symmetry. The Lincoln University flags are hung on street lights around the red dot. The sound of the flag’s bolts, heated stem from close buildings, and the engines of cars all come together in one, almost becoming a compositional record as if God was playing it. ‘Donald! Help me with some of the donuts’ Elias said to me. His short frame and gap tooth were his most prominent features. It was very light, so I wondered why that muscular guy needed my help to carry it.</p>\n<p>15 minutes later, we moved to the Student Union Building which is commonly called by its acronym S.U.B.  Lots of commercial activities take place at the S.U.B. The book store is located in the S.U.B. few meters away from the entrance by the left. We all sat down on the chairs by the right of the entrance. I kept the donuts on the table where I sat. Most of the chairs had round tables in their middle. We all ate the donuts and drank water, as we observed our surrounding. Most students usually sit here after purchasing food or snacks from the marvelous market because the chairs and tables are arranged just in front of the marvelous market.</p>\n<p>The guy sitting next to me wore a blue sweatshirt, Nike sneakers; beats head sets and a red school bag. Saggy jeans, hats worn to the side, big trainers, everybody looks like a hip hop video except the Nigerians and a few others. I could also hear the sound of music (Someone like you by Adele) from the theater upstairs.</p>\n<p>This day will remain one of my most memorable because I was very relaxed taking pictures and observing my surroundings. The serene environment of the Red Dot and the students’ union building eased some stress off me.</p>","excerpt":"It was a sunny day at The Lincoln University. The fall is set, and spring is upon us.
