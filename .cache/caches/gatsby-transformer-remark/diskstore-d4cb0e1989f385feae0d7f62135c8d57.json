The fall is set, and spring is upon us. Verdant green, red bloom and yellow sun rays were the characteristics of the day. The sun is bold, much bolder than back home at this time of the day. It was around 9.45am. I found myself heading for the University hall. This has been my weekly routine every Tuesday for the past two months. Our English lecturer, Professor Sturgis had earlier informed us that we will be going to the red dot and the students’ union building. We left the class around 10.15am for the site seeing.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":125},"end":{"line":4,"column":567,"offset":691}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":125},"end":{"line":4,"column":567,"offset":691}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Red Dot is located few meters away from the University hall.

Professor Sturgis must be a very nice man for getting us donuts and water. I could not wait to start eating it.
